  <h2>knowned cure</h2>
<ol>
<P> <li>Not at the moment, but drugs that are known to work against some viruses<br>
are being trialled in China, where there are thousands of patients, and new<br>
trials are starting in the US and other countries. Large numbers are needed<br>
to find out whether they work in a few people or a lot of people or nobody<br>
at all.</li></p>



<p><li>The most hopeful are <strong>Kaletra</strong>, which is a combination of two anti-HIV<br>
drugs, and remdesivir, which was tried but failed in Ebola patients in west<br>
Africa in 2013 and 2016. Some Chinese doctors are also trying <strong>chloroquine</strong>,<br>
an antimalarial drug, which is off-patent, therefore cheap and highly<br>
available, and would be very useful in low-income countries. The first<br>
results are expected in mid-March and should indicate if the drugs will<br>
at least help those who are most severely ill. A miracle cure is not expected.</li>
