  <h2>how to prevent it</h2>

<h3>wash your hands frequently</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an <br>
   alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water.</li>
 <li>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using <br>
   alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Maintain social distancing</h3>
  <ol>
  <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance <br>
    between yourself and anyone who is coughing or sneezing.</li>
  <li>Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid <br>
    droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If <br>
    you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets,including <br>
    the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing has the disease.</li>
  </ol>
<h3>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses.<br>
     Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,<br>
     nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and<br>
     can make you sick.</li>
</ol>
  <h3>Practice respiratory hygiene</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory<br>
    hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow<br>
    or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue <br>
    immediately.</li>
  <li>Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you<br>
     protect the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
</ol>
  <h3>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty<br>
     breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the <br>
     directions of your local health authority.</li>

  <li>Why? National and local authorities will have the most up to date<br>
    information on the situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow <br>
    your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility.<br>
   This will also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other <br>
   infections.</li>
</ol>
